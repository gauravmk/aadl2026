            <p class="text-lg mt-4">
              Rachel is an Ann Arbor educator, librarian, and active volunteer in the community. She is a local school
              librarian, chair of the elementary library department in the school district, and teachers’ union
              representative. She has worked in a variety of school settings and held various positions, including
              classroom teacher, librarian, summer and afterschool programs director, and interim head of school, among
              others. She feels most at ease when she is outside, surrounded by trees, or in a library, surrounded by
              people she loves, books she aspires to read, and hot coffee (kept away from the books, of course). She is
              also involved in the Jewish community, serving as an educator and volunteer with local organizations. In
              free time that she works very hard to carve out, she enjoys running on the Border to Border trail with her
              husband, Michael, as they try to keep up with their daughter, Margo (usually with limited success).

            <p class="text-lg mt-4">
              Gaurav grew up with the Ann Arbor District Library, back in a time before the Summer Game. Attending video
              game tournaments at the Downtown Branch expanded his ideas of what a library can be. Beyond having access
              to all the books you could imagine, he’s relied on libraries to borrow tools in times of need, print
              crosswords and super search puzzles, research local Ann Arbor history, and even <a
                class="text-blue-700 underline" target="_blank"

                his first dates with
                his now wife</a>, as they ran around museums and parks in search of Summer Game codes.

              Gaurav is a software engineer and a housing and transit advocate. He believes firmly that housing is a
              human right, and that communities are stronger when they lean on public services like libraries and public
              transit. He encourages everyone to give the bus a try, and will gladly help or even ride with anyone who
              feels overwhelmed with figuring out the bus and its schedule.

            <div class="text-4xl">What are your thoughts on the construction of a new Downtown Library?</div>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">We are elated about the new Downtown branch and take seriously the Board’s
              responsibility to steward this next phase of development. We are particularly excited about the potential
              for increased and varied opportunities for community programs, partnerships, housing, and access to
              resources.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">The new Downtown branch could be an iconic downtown landmark, in much the same way
              that the Austin, Boston and Cleveland public libraries are destinations. Ann Arbor deserves a downtown
              library that evokes awe.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">A larger library allows our incredibly popular events and expos to grow and
              accommodate all who want to attend. A larger library allows us to have a variety of spaces downtown, from
              conference rooms, to study spaces, to theater space, that are truly open to all. This would be
              transformational for our city because it would facilitate even more opportunities for groups and
              individuals to connect with one another and with the broader community.</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">The new building will also create housing opportunities for diverse residents. In
              the midst of a housing shortage and an affordability crisis, we need to build more housing. This is a
              unique opportunity to provide homes immediately above the library (which would be the <span class="italic">dream</span>) and across the street from
              the Blake Transit Center, one of the most active transit hubs in Michigan. We also know that mixed income
              housing benefits all residents, and are excited by the idea of a mix of affordable, senior, artist, and
              market-rate housing.</p>
